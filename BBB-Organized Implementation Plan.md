Bail Bonds Buddy Website - Organized Implementation Plan
Project Overview
You're building a programmatic SEO website (bailbondsbuddy.com) for bail bondsman services across US states, counties, and cities using Wordpress and Cursor IDE. The site will have thousands of pages generated from CSV data with optimized content for local bail bondsman services.
Data Structure
Your site will use these data files:

z-States.csv: All 50 US states with 2-letter codes and full state names
z-Oklahoma-County-Names.csv: All Oklahoma counties
z-Oklahoma-City-County.csv: All Oklahoma cities with their corresponding counties

You'll need similar county and city data for all other states to fully build out the site.
URL Structure
The site will have three levels of pages, each with a specific URL pattern:

State Pages (one per state):
bailbondsbuddy.com/[ModifierKeyword]-[Keyword]-[FullState]
Example: bailbondsbuddy.com/24Hour-Local-Emergency-Bail-Bondsman-in-Oklahoma

County Pages (one per county within a state):
bailbondsbuddy.com/[2LetterState]/[County]/[ModifierKeyword]-[Keyword]-[FullState]
Example: bailbondsbuddy.com/OK/Pontoc-County/24Hour-Local-Emergency-Bail-Bondsman-in-Oklahoma

City Pages (one per city within a county):
bailbondsbuddy.com/[2LetterState]/[County]/[ModifierKeyword]-[Keyword]-[City]-[FullState]
Example: bailbondsbuddy.com/OK/Pontoc-County/24Hour-Local-Emergency-Bail-Bondsman-in-Ada-Oklahoma


SEO Strategy

Use exact phrase match targeting for search queries
Create unique meta titles and descriptions for each page
Implement proper canonical URLs and structured data
Generate comprehensive sitemaps (split into smaller chunks due to the large number of pages)
Create a robots.txt file for proper search engine indexing
Implement internal linking between related pages

Interlinking Strategy
Each city page will:

Link to two other city pages in the same county
Link to its parent county page with breadcrumb navigation
All links should open in a new tab

Content Generation Strategy

Use different combinations of modifier keywords and keywords for variety
For each page type (state, county, city), create 5-7 different templates
Ensure each page has unique valuable content about bail bondsman services in that location
Include useful local information relevant to bail bonds services
