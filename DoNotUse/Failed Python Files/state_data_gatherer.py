Once bail is set, you can work with a licensed bondsman who charges a non-refundable fee (usually 10% of the total bail) to secure release. The bondsman then posts a surety bond with the court, guaranteeing the full bail amount if the defendant fails to appear for scheduled court dates.",

The bail bond is forfeited, meaning the full bail amount becomes due. The bondsman typically has a grace period to locate and surrender the defendant before paying the full amount. Recovery agents (bounty hunters) may be employed to find the defendant. Additionally, the person who signed for the bond may lose any collateral provided.",
            "When someone misses a court date in {state} after being released on a bail bond, several consequences follow: the court issues a failure to appear (FTA) warrant; the bond is forfeited; and additional criminal charges for failure to appear may be filed. The bail bondsman will immediately begin searching for the defendant, often using recovery agents. The indemnitor (person who signed for the bond) becomes liable for the full bail amount plus recovery costs, and any collateral used to secure the bond may be claimed.",
            "Failing to appear for court dates in {state} after posting bail triggers serious consequences: immediate issuance of an arrest warrant, bond forfeiture proceedings, and possible additional criminal charges that can carry separate penalties.
