# Analysis of Existing Scripts and Oklahoma Page Structure

## Oklahoma Page Structure
Based on the screenshots, the Oklahoma page has the following structure:
1. Header with navigation
2. State image with caption ("Oklahoma: The Sooner State")
3. Main content section with state-specific information:
   - Population data (4 million residents, 77 counties)
   - Metropolitan areas (Oklahoma City and Tulsa)
   - Economic information (energy, aerospace, biotechnology)
   - Bail system regulations (Oklahoma Bail Bondsmen Act)
   - Criminal justice context (reform initiatives)
   - Geographical considerations (interstate highways, drug trafficking)
   - Weather factors (tornadoes, ice storms)
4. Major Counties section (Oklahoma County, Tulsa County, Cleveland County)
5. Generic content about bail bondsmen services
6. FAQ section with 5 questions
7. Search functionality
8. Footer with navigation links

## Existing Python Scripts
From the screenshots, I can see several Python scripts in the file explorer:
- extract_json_content.py
- json_template_page.py
- create_state_page.py
- create_state_page2.py
- create_state_page3.py through create_state_page12.py

### extract_json_content.py Analysis
This script:
- Extracts raw content from JSON file and processes placeholders
- Uses the EXACT JSON file content directly
- No parsing or re-serializing of JSON
- Handles replacement in raw content
- Has constants:
  - BASE_URL = "https://bailbondsbuddy.com"
  - AUTH = ("budddy", "Open cizB yNjx 5qeN G31G fqu6")
  - JSON_TEMPLATE_FILE = "BailBondsBuddy.com _ Find Local Trusted Bail Bondsman in [state].json"
  - FAQ_FILE = "FAQ.md"
- Contains state data for Oklahoma with:
  - Abbreviation: "OK"
  - Capital: "Oklahoma City"
  - Address: "Oklahoma City, OK"
  - Lat/Long coordinates
  - Counties: ["Oklahoma County", "Tulsa County", "Cleveland County"]

## Issues Identified
1. One script maintains formatting but can't replace variables
2. The other script replaces variables but loses formatting
3. The Python script in Cursor is not working properly according to the user

## Requirements for New Solution
1. Maintain exact formatting of WordPress/Divi theme
2. Successfully replace all state-specific variables
3. Generate unique content for each state
4. Include the three largest counties for each state
5. Create unique FAQ sections with different questions and answers
6. Include state-specific images with proper SEO optimization
7. Simple solution for a non-coder who uses Cursor IDE
