provides example data, generates state-specific pages based on a template,
and can upload these pages to a WordPress site.

Usage:
  python3 combined_cline_state.py --state [StateName]         # Generate a state page
  python3 combined_cline_state.py --state [StateName] --upload # Generate and upload to WordPress
  python3 combined_cline_state.py --all                       # Generate all state pages
  python3 combined_cline_state.py --all --upload              # Generate and upload all state pages
