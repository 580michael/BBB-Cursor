## Directory Structure

Set up your directories as follows:

```
/bailbonds/
├── improved_page_generator_part1.py
├── improved_page_generator_part2.py
├── improved_page_generator_part3.py
├── content_generator_utils_part1.py
├── content_generator_utils_part2.py
├── content_generator_utils_part3.py
├── "Oklahoma Bail Bondsman Emergency 24_7 Service.json"  (Original template file)
├── "Find Local [state-name] Bail Bondsmen Nearby Emergency Service.json"  (New variablized template)
├── generated_pages/  (Will be created automatically)
└── state_data/  (Will be created automatically)
```

## Template JSON File with Variables

The file `Find Local [state-name] Bail Bondsmen Nearby Emergency Service.json` is a template JSON file where all content has been replaced with descriptive variables. This template is used by the Python scripts to generate state-specific pages by replacing the variables with actual state data.

### Variable Structure

The template uses the following variables that are replaced during page generation:

#### Header Variables
- `[MAIN_HEADER_WITH_STATE]` - Main title including state name
- `[SECONDARY_HEADER_WITH_STATE]` - Subtitle including state name

#### Map Variables
- `[STATE_CAPITAL_MAP_ADDRESS]` - Full address of the state capital
- `[STATE_CAPITAL_LAT]` - Latitude of the state capital
- `[STATE_CAPITAL_LNG]` - Longitude of the state capital

#### Content Section Variables
- `[GUIDE_TITLE_WITH_STATE]` - Title for the guide section
- `[GUIDE_SUBTITLE]` - Subtitle for the guide section
- `[INTRO_PARAGRAPH_WITH_STATE]` - First introductory paragraph
- `[SECOND_INTRO_PARAGRAPH_WITH_STATE]` - Second introductory paragraph

#### Feature Section Variables
- `[AVAILABILITY_PARAGRAPH_WITH_STATE]` - Content for 24/7 availability section
- `[VERIFIED_BONDSMAN_PARAGRAPH_WITH_STATE]` - Content for verified bondsman section
- `[NATIONWIDE_COVERAGE_PARAGRAPH_WITH_STATE]` - Content for nationwide coverage section

#### County Section Variables
- `[MAJOR_COUNTIES_HEADING_WITH_STATE]` - Heading for counties section
- `[COUNTY_1_NAME]`, `[COUNTY_2_NAME]`, `[COUNTY_3_NAME]` - Names of major counties
- `[COUNTY_INTRO_PARAGRAPH]` - Introduction paragraph about counties
- `[COUNTY_SECOND_PARAGRAPH_WITH_STATE]` - Second paragraph about counties

#### FAQ Section Variables
- `[FAQ1_QUESTION_WITH_STATE]` through `[FAQ5_QUESTION_WITH_STATE]` - FAQ questions
- `[FAQ1_ANSWER_WITH_STATE]` through `[FAQ5_ANSWER_WITH_STATE]` - FAQ answers

#### State Information Variables
- `[STATE_IMAGE_URL]` - URL to state image
- `[STATE_NAME]` - State name
- `[STATE_NICKNAME_HEADING]` - Heading with state nickname
- `[STATE_INTRO_PARAGRAPH_WITH_NICKNAME]` - Intro paragraph with state nickname
- `[STATE_METRO_PARAGRAPH_WITH_CITIES]` - Paragraph about metropolitan areas
- `[STATE_ECONOMY_PARAGRAPH]` - Paragraph about state economy
- `[STATE_BAIL_SYSTEM_PARAGRAPH]` - Paragraph about state bail system
- `[STATE_CRIMINAL_JUSTICE_PARAGRAPH]` - Paragraph about criminal justice system
- `[STATE_GEOGRAPHY_PARAGRAPH_WITH_INTERSTATES]` - Paragraph about geography
- `[STATE_WEATHER_PARAGRAPH]` - Paragraph about weather
- `[STATE_CONCLUSION_PARAGRAPH]` - Conclusion paragraph

This template provides a consistent structure for all state pages while allowing for unique content generation for each state. The Python scripts read this template and replace all variables with state-specific content.

## How to Generate State Pages

### Step 1: Set Up Files

1. Copy all six Python files to your Cursor IDE
2. Make sure your template JSON files are in the same directory
3. Create the directory structure as shown above

### Step 2: Test with Texas

Run this command to test the script with Texas:

```bash
python3 improved_page_generator_part3.py --test
```

This will:
- Generate a Texas page based on your template
- Create both JSON and HTML files in the `generated_pages` directory
- Show you the results so you can verify everything looks correct

### Step 3: Generate All State Pages

Once you're satisfied with the Texas test, run this command to generate all 49 state pages:

```bash
python3 improved_page_generator_part3.py --all
```

This will:
- Generate pages for all 49 remaining states
- Create JSON files ready to import into WordPress
- Create HTML preview files for easy content review

### Step 4: Import to WordPress

You have two options for importing the content to WordPress:

1. **JSON Import**: Use a WordPress plugin that supports importing JSON files with Divi formatting
2. **Manual Creation**: Use the HTML preview files as a reference to manually create pages in Divi

## Future Implementation: County Pages (Phase 2)

For Phase 2 (county pages), we'll follow a similar approach but with county-specific data:

### Planned File Structure for County Pages

1. **county_page_generator_part1.py**
   - Will contain core functions for loading county data
   - Will handle template loading and county-specific processing

2. **county_page_generator_part2.py**
   - Will contain content replacement for county-specific information
   - Will generate unique content for each county

3. **county_page_generator_part3.py**
   - Will contain main execution logic for generating county pages
   - Will include functions to process counties for each state

4. **county_content_utils_part1.py**, **county_content_utils_part2.py**, **county_content_utils_part3.py**
   - Will contain utilities for generating unique county content
   - Will create county-specific FAQs, information sections, etc.

### County Data Structure

For county pages, we'll need to gather this information for each county:

- County name
- County population
- County seat (main city)
- Courthouse address and phone number
- County jail address and phone number
- Local bail bond regulations specific to the county
- Major cities within the county
- Any unique aspects of the county's criminal justice system

### Implementation Approach for County Pages

1. **Create County Template**: We'll use one of your existing county sections as a template
2. **Gather County Data**: We'll collect data for all counties in each state
3. **Develop County Scripts**: We'll create scripts similar to the state page generators
4. **Generate County Pages**: We'll generate pages for all counties in each state

## Conclusion

You now have a complete solution for generating unique content for all 49 state pages. The scripts are designed to:

1. Maintain the exact WordPress/Divi formatting from your Oklahoma page
2. Include state names in all headings (e.g., "Find Local Texas Bail Bondsmen Near You")
3. Create completely unique content for all sections to avoid duplicate content penalties
4. Generate unique FAQ questions and answers for each state
5. Properly format everything to match your Oklahoma page

When you're ready to move to Phase 2 (county pages), we can adapt these scripts to generate county-specific content following a similar approach.
